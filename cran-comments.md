As suggested, 

+ I've included within the desciption this type of reference: 

Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Mohamed El Fodil Ihaddaden",
           family = "Ihaddaden",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "ihaddaden.fodeil@gmail.com")
           
           
+ I've modified the T to TRUE


Thank you very much for your comments.
